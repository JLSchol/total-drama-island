# Round 5

## Algorithm challenge

The final round of the challenge is already here! And surprise, no new products are introduced for a change. Dull? Probably not, as you do get another treat. The island exchange now discloses to you who the counterparty is you have traded against. This means that the `counter_party` property of the `OwnTrade` object is now populated. Perhaps interesting to see if you can leverage this information to make your algorithm even more profitable?

```python
class OwnTrade:
    def __init__(self, symbol: Symbol, price: int, quantity: int, counter_party: UserId = None) -> None:
        self.symbol = symbol
        self.price: int = price
        self.quantity: int = quantity
        self.counter_party = counter_party
```

A mysterious bottle washed ashore with some scriptures in it. To some these might look like old rags. To others these might prove to contain essential information, or even the key to a prosperous future. Whatever you do, don't throw it back in the ocean, because it will only be a matter of time before it reappears again.

Bashir Beetle
A real smooth talker. The kind of trader who can sell sand in a desert. Isn’t afraid to burn his legs on scorching hot sand or a risky trading strategy.”

A hopeless romantic with a fierce attitude. She’s pretty fed up with everyone asking what happened to Clyde. And don’t even think about asking about her trading secrets—she’ll take them to the grave.

Your objective is to develop a trading strategy that maximizes your profit. You have 1.000.000 SeaShells available as trading capital and can choose to either buy or sell different goods. Specify the percentage you want to buy or sell for, and make sure it doesn’t exceed your total available capital. Note that there are fees involved in these trades.

Good luck and have fun trading!
