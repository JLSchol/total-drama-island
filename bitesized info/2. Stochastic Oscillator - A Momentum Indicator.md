# **Stochastic Oscillator - A Momentum Indicator**  
The **Stochastic Oscillator** is a momentum indicator used to identify **overbought** and **oversold** price levels. It works similarly to the **Relative Strength Index (RSI)** but presents itself as a graph with two stochastic lines.

## **How to Read the Stochastic Oscillator**  
- 📈 **Overbought Zone** (**Above 80%**) → The asset is considered **expensive** and may be due for a trend reversal **downward**.  
- 📉 **Oversold Zone** (**Below 20%**) → The asset is considered **cheap** and may be due for a trend reversal **upward**.  

The stochastic oscillator consists of two lines:  
- **%K Line** (Fast-moving line)  
- **%D Line** (Slow-moving average of %K)  

A **crossover** between these lines can signal a potential momentum shift.  
## **Crossover Method: Identifying Trend Reversals**  
### **Uptrend Scenario**  
- **Bullish Momentum**: **%K > %D** → Buyers remain strong, and the uptrend continues.  
- **Bearish Reversal Signal**: After a strong uptrend, if **%D crosses over %K**, this indicates **momentum loss** from buyers and a potential trend reversal downward.  

### **Downtrend Scenario**  
- **Bearish Momentum**: **%K < %D** → Sellers remain in control, and the downtrend continues.  
- **Bullish Reversal Signal**: After a downtrend, if **%K crosses over %D**, this signals **momentum loss** from sellers and a potential upward trend shift.  

🔹 **Key Trading Tip**  
Pair the **crossover method** with **key support and resistance levels** to improve accuracy and reduce false signals.

## **Stochastic Oscillator + Divergence: High-Quality Trade Setups**  
Combining the **Stochastic Oscillator** with **divergence** helps traders identify **reversal and continuation setups** with higher confidence.

### **Types of Divergence**  
- **📉 Regular Divergence** → Signals a potential **trend reversal**  
- **📈 Hidden Divergence** → Suggests a **trend continuation**

## **When is Regular Divergence Most Valuable?**  
A **regular divergence** has a higher probability of success when:  
✅ It occurs at a **key support or resistance level**  
✅ It is confirmed by **price breaking through a key level**, such as:  
   - A **support/resistance level**  
   - A **trendline (e.g., moving average)**  

📌 **Example:** A price breaking through **support after a divergence** confirms the trend shift.

## **Trading Strategy: Regular Divergence Reversal**
1. 📌 **Scenario**: The price is forming **higher highs**, but the Stochastic Oscillator is forming **lower highs** → **Bearish Regular Divergence** detected. 
2.  📉 **Price Action**: The price reaches a **key resistance level**, failing to break higher. 
3. 👀 **Plan**: Wait for price confirmation, such as a **bearish engulfing candle** or a **break below support level**
4. 🎯 **Entry**: Enter a **short trade** after price confirms the reversal. 
5. 📍 **Stop-Loss**: Set above the recent high or resistance level. 
6. 🚀 **Take Profit**: Target the next **key support level** or high-volume area.

 ## hidden divergence
 - **📈 Hidden Divergence** → Suggests a **trend continuation**  
 - use support and resistance levels to config trend similar to regular divergence
